Solutions to CVRP (Capacited Vehicle Routing Problem) using various methods

1. Greedy Solution
2. Local Search (Within vehicle)
3. Local Search (Within all vehicles chosen by initial greedy solution)
4. Genetic Algorithm (Includes manipulation of iterators chat point to positions in the gene where the next vehicle is to begin)

This repository is currently in its initial stage where most of the algorithms have been coded in without optimsations. Its basic purpose is to give an example as to how each of the optimization methods listed above might be applied to the CVRP.

TODOS:
1. Tabu search
2. Simulated Annealing
3. Improve Local Search (all vehicle variant) to include vehicles not picked by the initial solution
4. Refactor
5. Code documentation
